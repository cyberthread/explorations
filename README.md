# explorations
Explorations are blocks of time to step away from projects and to play in the code. Each exploration should focus on a key technical skill that you want to develop. The best way to build your portfolio of skills is by trying to put news skills and techniques into action by making. What we make during explorations shouldn't be a complete polished project or even a complete design thought. You should feel like you have the freedom to tinker and try things without feeling like you will fail or break something.

## this repository
Create separate directories for each exploration or use individual HTML files with internal stylesheets to help you organize.
